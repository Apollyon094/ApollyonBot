# ApollyonBot
ApollyonBot is a bot I have been working on for years now. I only got around to fixing, cleaning it up and open sourcing it.
## Installation
ApollyonBot requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to even function.
## Usage
First, download the dependencies into the ApollyonBot folder.
```bash
npm install
```
That installs all the libraries needed. This could take up to 3 minutes.
You need to edit the configuration in the ./config folder to get the bot running on discord. Make sure to [set up the bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications) first.

Then launch it:
```bash
node bot_core
```
## Contributing
I am not seeking contributions right now. Fork it all you want and add stuff.
## License
[GNU GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)
## Invite bot
[Invite it](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=569290831031304243&scope=bot)
The bot is usually unable to join since it is in 100 guilds. No, I am not sacrificing my privacy for a stupid discord bot. If you want this in your server and can't host it, look for a mirror or host it yourself
If you do host it yourself, be aware of the limitations of the GNU GPLv3 license. Open source the bot.
