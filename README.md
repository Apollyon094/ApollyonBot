# ApollyonBot
ApollyonBot is a bot I have been working on for years now. I only got around to fixing, cleaning it up and open sourcing it.
## Installation
ApollyonBot requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to even function.
## Usage
First, download the dependencies into the ApollyonBot folder.
```bash
npm install
```
That installs all the libraries needed. This could take up to 3 minutes.
You need to edit the configuration in the ./config folder to get the bot running on discord. Make sure to [set up the bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications) first.

Then launch it:
```bash
node bot_core
```
